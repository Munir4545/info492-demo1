### Email Draft

**Dear Ms. Potter,**

I am a fourth-year student at the University of Washington conducting a capstone research project on emerging cybersecurity challenges in the trucking industry, with a focus on the Pacific Northwest logistics corridor. I came across your work with the Washington Trucking Associations' Safety Management Council and was impressed by your leadership in DOT safety compliance and industry education.

Our project examines how AI technologies may impact logistics security, especially GPS systems, routing software, and operational technology used by drivers and dispatchers. We aim to identify vulnerabilities and recommend practical defensive measures that align with existing safety frameworks.

I would be grateful if you could participate in a 20–30 minute interview (via phone or Zoom, at your convenience) to share insights on:

- Technology systems used in trucking operations  
- Security and safety training practices  
- Operational challenges and vulnerabilities  
- Industry preparedness for technology-enabled threats  

This is strictly for educational purposes:

- IRB-approved with informed consent  
- Anonymous participation available if preferred  
- No confidential information required  

If your schedule does not allow an interview, I would greatly appreciate brief responses to these questions instead:

1. How do drivers typically receive route updates (e.g., mobile apps, in-cab systems, text messages, other)?
2. Where do you see the biggest security gaps or vulnerabilities in Washington trucking operations?
3. Have you heard of AI being used in attacks against logistics companies? How prepared do you think the industry is for AI-enabled threats?

Thank you very much for considering this request. Your expertise would provide invaluable perspective for our research.

**Best regards,**

### Email Draft

**Dear Mr. Kaplan,**

I am a fourth-year student at the University of Washington, Seattle, conducting a capstone research project on emerging AI-enabled cybersecurity threats to logistics infrastructure, with a specific focus on the Pacific Northwest supply chain corridor (Tacoma Port → Eastern WA). Your Center of Excellence's mission to support workforce development and your partnerships with logistics industry stakeholders make you an ideal resource for our research. I'm particularly impressed by your *Follow the Supply Chain* program and the Center's focus on practical industry applications.

Our research examines how AI agents could orchestrate coordinated attacks against last-mile delivery systems—targeting GPS manipulation, API exploitation, and social engineering vectors. The goal is to help the logistics industry understand and prepare for these emerging threats.  

I'm hoping the Center might assist our research in one or more ways:

1. Your perspective on current cybersecurity practices and workforce skills gaps in logistics  
2. Potential introductions to logistics professionals (drivers, dispatchers, fleet managers) willing to share operational insights through brief interviews (20–30 minutes)  

**Research Details:**

- Educational research only (no testing of real systems)  
- IRB-approved protocol with informed consent  
- All participants can remain anonymous if preferred  
- Results shared with industry to improve security preparedness  
- Aligned with workforce development goals (identifying training needs)  

Would you be available for a brief conversation (20–30 minutes) to discuss potential collaboration? I'm happy to work around your schedule and can meet via Zoom or phone. Our findings could inform future Center of Excellence curriculum development around cybersecurity skills gaps in the logistics sector—an area of growing industry concern.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to potentially collaborating with the Center.

**Best regards,**

## Interview Questions

### Questions for Abigail

#### Technology & Systems
1. What routing and dispatch software do most Washington trucking companies use? Are these systems typically cloud-based or on-premise?  
   *Validates:* Technology assumptions for attack simulation  
2. How do drivers typically receive route updates during their shifts — via mobile apps, in-cab systems, text messages, software, or other?  
   *Validates:* GPS manipulation attack vector  
3. When GPS or routing systems act strangely, or in higher-stress situations when things aren’t going as planned, what do drivers usually do? Do they report it or work around it?  
   *Validates:* Normalization of anomalies assumption  
4. What authentication methods do most carriers require for drivers accessing routing systems — just passwords, multi-factor authentication, or something else?  
   *Validates:* Weak authentication vulnerability  
5. How common is it for drivers to use personal devices versus company-issued equipment?  
   *Validates:* BYOD vulnerability  

#### Security & Training
6. What cybersecurity training do drivers and dispatchers typically receive, and how often is this training?  
   *Validates:* Low security awareness assumption  
7. If a driver received an email or call claiming to be from dispatch with a route change, is there a verification process they’re supposed to follow?  
   *Validates:* Social engineering vulnerability  
8. In your role working with carriers across Washington, where do you see the biggest security gaps or vulnerabilities firsthand?  
   *Gets perspective on attack surface*

#### Impact & Industry Preparedness
9. If a major carrier's routing system went down for 24–48 hours in the Tacoma-to-Eastern Washington corridor, what would the operational impact look like?  
   *Validates:* Impact estimates  
10. Have you heard about AI being used in attacks against logistics companies? How prepared do you think the Washington trucking industry is for AI-enabled threats?  
    *Assesses:* Current threat awareness

### Stakeholder Feedback

Professor Shi Chen is the Marion B. Ingersoll Professor of Operations Management at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington in Seattle. He holds a Ph.D. in Operations Management from Stanford University, as well as degrees from Tsinghua University and École Centrale Paris. Professor Chen is a leading researcher in supply chain management, stochastic inventory models, and resilience/resource optimization in logistics networks.

"The demonstration overall serves your purpose, and the simulated scenarios reflect the realism. Two directions for future research to extend/generalize the current framework: (1) Simulate the recovery process of the system, as shipping firms are naturally interested in how quickly they could identify the problem and bring the system back to normal — this shows the “responsiveness” of the system. (2)  Simulate responses from upstream and/or downstream clients (e.g., senders and receivers); for example, impatient receivers may call the shipping firm to inquire about the delayed shipment, which further floods the fleet management team."
